		<h2>What is Boreal Forest?</h2>
		<p>
			The boreal forest is the world's largest land biome. 
			The boreal ecozone principally spans 8 countries: Canada, China, 
			Finland, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. 
			It is typically comprised of coniferous tree species such as pine, 
			spruce and fir with some broadleaf species such as poplar and birch.
			From a biological perspective, boreal forests are 
			defined as forests growing in high-latitude environments 
			where freezing temperatures occur for 6 to 8 months and in 
			which trees are capable of reaching a minimum height of 5 m 
			and a canopy cover of 10%. (source: ibfra.org)

		<h2>Flora of Boreal Forest</h2>
		<p>
			Boreal forest ecosystems have evolved under the 
			constraints imposed by a short growing season and 
			severe winters during which snow cover may last for 
			al months. About one-third of their extent is underlain 
			by permafrost. As noted above, most boreal landscapes 
			are characterized by a low diversity of tree species, 
			of which gymnosperms such as Abies, Larix, Pinus, and 
			Picea species usually dominate, with varying proportions
			 of angiosperm Populus, Betula, and Alnus species.  
			 This low tree diversity belies the thousands of species of 
			 living organisms that thrive within boreal stands. (source: ibfra.org)

		<h2>Fauna of Boreal Forest</h2>
		<p>
			The boreal forest shelters more than 85 species of mammals, 
			including some of the largest and most majestic—wood bison, 
			elk, moose, woodland caribou, grizzly and black bears, and 
			wolves—and smaller species, such as beavers, snowshoe hares, 
			Canada lynx, red squirrels, lemmings, and voles. (source: hww.ca)
